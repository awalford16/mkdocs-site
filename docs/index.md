## Welcome

My name is Adam. I am an infrastructure engineer working on the University of Cambridge Supercomputer, specialising in deploying datacenter infrastructure and managing automation of datacenter servers and networks.

I have put this site together mostly as a note-taking practice for my own reference, but if you happen to stumble across it, I hope you find something useful for yourself in here.

## Services

I am also availble to offer technical advice for anyone hosting their own services in the cloud or on-premise, either through consultation, or general technical support.

Please get in touch if you would like support with any of the following:

- Deploying AI models on-prem or in the cloud
- Setting up cloud/hybrid/on-prem network infrastructure
- Auto-scaling solutions in the cloud
- Adding/Improving observability and monitoring of any infrastructure
- Diagnosing issues with cloud/on-prem/hybrid networks
- Diagnosing issues with services running on Docker or K8s
- Hardware migrations or system upgrades
