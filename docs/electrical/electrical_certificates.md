## Electrical Installation Certificate

An electrical installation certificate should be completed for all work which is not considered to be "minor works" (see Minor Works Certificate below).

The certificate should be accompanied with a Schedule of Circuit Details and a Schedule of Tests which detail the test results for each of the circuits installed.

## Minor Works Certificate

A minor works certificate is completed whenever the work does not involve an entire new circuit, or the installation is not in a special location such as outside or in a bathroom. Additionally, replacement of a consumer unit would not be covered by minor works.

Minor works covers changes such as adding a spur socket off of a ring circuit, or extending a radial lighting circuit with a new light.

## Electrical Installation Condition Report

Electrical condition reports are completed on a periodic basis. The period depends on the type of installation and type of premises. For instance, hospitals require more frequent inspections.

The condition report requires a sample of the installation to be inspected and tested rather than the full installation.

If there are defects identified during the inspection, fault codes can be assigned based on the severity of the defect.

Code | Description
---|---
C1 | Immediate danger, replace as a priority
C2 | Potential to cause harm
C3 | Recommended Improvement
F | Further investigation required

An example of an `F` code usage would typically be when there is an area of the site that cannot be accessed during the inspection.
