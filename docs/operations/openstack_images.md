## Baremetal Images and User Images

Baremetal servers managed in Ironic require their own deploy images which prepare the BM server for OS deployments.

On top of these baremetal images, user images are deployed which are the images actually used by the end user.

## Disk Image Builder

You can install the diskimage-builder package to be able to build user images.
